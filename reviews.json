You should be ashamed of yourself for ruining students' futures, time, and money. If you have even the smallest amount of morality, quit your job and release all the CS students from this torment."

Her demeaning behavior, including calling students slow, stupid, or screw-ups, creates a hostile environment that undermines confidence and discourages learning. Do not take if you do not have a strong background in CS."

The first half was more difficult than the second. Do the extra credit, it helps your understanding and your grade. She also tells you exactly what will be on the exams. That helped me ace the final."
